Backlog:

  To do:
    - Move state logic from championsInfo to championsSearch?
    - Add No champions match the filter criteria or not champions found to searcher
    - create a wrapper function to generate datadragon cdn
    - loading spinner
    - when the name is too long (for example Nunu and Willump) only 2 columns is shown on mobile

  Doing:
    - Centering content on Desktop and adding a max-width of 960px

  Done:
    - champions filters by tag. Remember if search !== empty filter also by tag
    - champions filtering by Search
      Why it is slow ?
        It is only slow because the bandwidth that takes to load all the images from the server
        (it is not slow because react). If we remove the image or enable cache on chrome it will be fast af again.

    - show correct image for each champions
    - Reading and Understanding LOL API and DataDragon
    - Seting up Project, initial files and files structure
    - Start Working on V1, Static Components 
    - Add helpers API data fetchers
    - Add initial State and Data fetching
    - Show Champions List 
  
  Limits:
    Champions By role (top, mid, jungle, bottom, support)
      the api does not give this data and it's hard to maintain that for them between patch
